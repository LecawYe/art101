				<h1>Yihan Wang</h1>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
				<p>Hello! My name is Wang Yihan, and I'm currently in my senior year pursuing a major in AGPM. Although I grew up in China, I've been studying in the United States since high school. I'm proud to be fluent in both Chinese and English and also have a basic understanding of Spanish and Japanese. One of my greatest passions is traveling; I relish the excitement of exploring places I've never been before. Additionally, I have a profound love for anime, which played a significant role in my decision to choose my current major. My dream is to harness my skills to bring to life the unique world that exists in my imagination.</p>

				<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h1>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>It's a challenge for me because it's my first time dealing with HTML and CSS, and I'm really eager to understand and learn them. All this knowledge is unfamiliar to me, but for me, it's not difficult; I pick things up quickly.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It took me a long time to figure out how to link images on the web page, especially because the images were ones I had taken myself and were just files on my computer. Initially, when I used computer-based links, I couldn't get the images to display on the webpage. Later on, I found a website dedicated to posting images that could generate HTML code directly, which surprised me. Afterward, I was able to get the images to display on the webpage, but then I realized that the image dimensions were too large. I then spent some time thinking about how to use CSS to adjust the image dimensions. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>My progress on completing this assignment has been very smooth. Perhaps it's because this is my first time encountering new knowledge, which has kept me very focused on completing the assignment. I also pay attention to things like font choices, image dimensions, and layout to make it more visually appealing. So, while working on Lab 2, I spent a lot of time browsing through Chrome to understand HTML and CSS concepts better. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I'm very satisfied with the final result. The font colors and sizes, as well as the harmony between images and background colors, turned out well. The image dimensions are just right, not too large, and the images have links as well. Everything came together nicely.</p>
