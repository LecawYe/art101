				<h1>YIHAN WANG</h1>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
				<p>Hello! My name is Wang Yihan, and I'm currently in my senior year pursuing a major in AGPM. Although I grew up in China, I've been studying in the United States since high school. I'm proud to be fluent in both Chinese and English and also have a basic understanding of Spanish and Japanese. One of my greatest passions is traveling; I relish the excitement of exploring places I've never been before. Additionally, I have a profound love for anime, which played a significant role in my decision to choose my current major. My dream is to harness my skills to bring to life the unique world that exists in my imagination.</p>

				<p>This experiment primarily focuses on the sequential layout of paragraph themes in articles and how to create links to other web pages. </p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>During the experiment, I encountered a problem with adding images in VS Code. Initially, no matter how many methods I tried, I couldn't see the added images in the files. After a series of research and attempts, I discovered that I must first commit on GitHub for VS Code to track the images. Once successfully tracked, I can freely use them in the HTML file.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I carried out my work step by step as required, and here are the screenshots.</p>
