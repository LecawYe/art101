					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>During the experiment, I encountered a problem with adding images in VS Code. Initially, no matter how many methods I tried, I couldn't see the added images in the files. After a series of research and attempts, I discovered that I must first commit on GitHub for VS Code to track the images. Once successfully tracked, I can freely use them in the HTML file.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I carried out my work step by step as required, and here are the screenshots.</p>
