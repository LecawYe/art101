			<div class="minor-section">
				<p>Hello! My name is Wang Yihan, and I'm currently in my senior year pursuing a major in AGPM. Although I grew up in China, I've been studying in the United States since high school. I'm proud to be fluent in both Chinese and English and also have a basic understanding of Spanish and Japanese. One of my greatest passions is traveling; I relish the excitement of exploring places I've never been before. Additionally, I have a profound love for anime, which played a significant role in my decision to choose my current major. My dream is to harness my skills to bring to life the unique world that exists in my imagination.</p>
